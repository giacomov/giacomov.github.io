# Software

1. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood Framework ([3ML](https://github.com/giacomov/3ML)) is a framework for Maximum Likelihood and
Bayesian analysis of multi-wavelength, multi-messenger datasets.

2. [gtburst](https://github.com/giacomov/gtburst) is a software for the analysis of the data from the [Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).
It works around a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and it is part of the official [Fermi Science Tools](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/)

3. The Fermi Gravitational Waves toolkit ([fermi_gw_toolkit](https://github.com/giacomov/fermi_gw_toolkit)) is a software for the search of Gravitational Waves counterparts in the data of the
[Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).
It is described in [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa7262/meta) of mine.

4. The Bayesian Blocks Burst Detector ([bbbd](https://github.com/giacomov/bbbd)) is a software for the detection of bursts (i.e., peaks) in time series based
on a modified version of the Bayesian Block algorithm of [Scargle 2013](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/764/2/167/meta)

5. The Fermi blind search software ([fermi_blind_search](https://github.com/giacomov/fermi_blind_search)) implements
a blind search for transients in the data of the [Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).

6. X-ray Divide and Conquer ([XtDac](https://github.com/giacomov/XtDac)) implements a blind search for transients
in the data of X-ray telescopes XMM-Netwton and Chandra.

7. Minimum Variability Time scale ([mvts](https://github.com/giacomov/mvts)) implements a minimum-variability analysis based on wavelets for light
curves.

8. The Gamma-Gamma opacity template generator ([pyggop](https://github.com/giacomov/pyggop)) generates templates for gamma-gamma opacity. See the paper 
"Opacity buildup in impulsive relativistic sources", Granot et al. 2008.

9. [freeDegreeEst](https://github.com/giacomov/freeDegreeEst) is a python wrapper around the code from Willet et al. 2007 for the density estimation of a non-uniform Poisson process
