# Software

## The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood Framework

[3ML](https://github.com/giacomov/3ML) is a framework for Maximum Likelihood and
Bayesian analysis of multi-wavelength, multi-messenger datasets.

## gtburst

[gtburst](https://github.com/giacomov/gtburst) is a software for the analysis of the data from the [Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).
It works around a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and it is part of the official
[Fermi Science Tools](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/)

## Fermi Gravitational Waves toolkit

The [fermi_gw_toolkit](https://github.com/giacomov/fermi_gw_toolkit) is a software for the search of Gravitational Waves counterparts in the data of the
[Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).
It is described in [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa7262/meta) of mine.

## Bayesian Blocks Burst Detection

[bbbd](https://github.com/giacomov/bbbd) is a software for the detection of 
bursts (i.e., peaks) in time series.

## Fermi blind search

[fermi_blind_search](https://github.com/giacomov/fermi_blind_search) implements
a blind search for transients in the data of the [Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/fermi-gamma-ray-space-telescope).

## X-ray Divide and Conquer

[XtDac](https://github.com/giacomov/XtDac) implements a blind search for transients
in the data of X-ray telescopes XMM-Netwton and Chandra.

## Minimum Variability Time scale

[mvts](https://github.com/giacomov/mvts) implements a minimum-variability analysis based on wavelets for light
curves.

## Gamma-Gamma opacity

Generates templates for gamma-gamma opacity. See the paper 
"Opacity buildup in impulsive relativistic sources", Granot et al. 2008.

## freeDegreeEst

A python wrapper around the code from Willet et al. 2007
